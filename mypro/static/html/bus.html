Arupadaiveedu and is dedicated to(Kartikeya) Murugan.In October 2022 Tiruttani is a part of Chennai

Thiruthani has more to offer than just the Subramanyaswamy Temple.
The Santhana Venugopalapuram Temple is another popular shrine where devotees
and tourists numbering in thousands visit each year. The school where Indiaâ€™s first President,
late Dr. Sarvapalli Radha Krishnan, studied can also be viewed in Tiruttani.

Nature lovers can spend an hour or even a day on the banks of the small yet
beautiful Nandi River that flows through the town. Close by is the Kumara Teertha, 
which is also known locally as Saravana Poikai. This man-made water body at the foot of the hill, 
atop which the temple is perched, is believed to be full of holy water with therapeutic powers.
